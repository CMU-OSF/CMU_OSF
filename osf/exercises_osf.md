*  OSF allows you to connect with multiple add-on tools for storage and citation management such as GitHub, Google Drive and Mendeley.
* Go to [http://help.osf.io/m/addons](http://help.osf.io/m/addons). Choose an add-on from the list that you typically use and  follow OSF's step-by-step instructions to connect it to the project.
